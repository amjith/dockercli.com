dockercli
=========

:slug: index

Dockercli provides a more convenient way to enter Docker commands. It
autocompletes commands and parameters as you type, and has syntax
highlighting.

Dockercli is a Python package. It can be installed from PyPi:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install dockercli

Then run it with:

.. code:: bash

    $ dockercli

Once you're inside the prompt, just type in your usual Docker commands,
except there's no need to prefix everything with "docker". Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ run --detach --name foo ubuntu:14.04
